# Crime Analysis Project
This project analyzes crime trends in Boston and Los Angeles from 2020 to 2024, focusing on fluctuations in crime rates during major events such as economic recessions and public health crises. This project aims to provide data support for improving public safety strategies and policy recommendations by studying the correlation between socioeconomic factors such as unemployment and crime rates.

# Future Work
Potential next steps for this project include:

Expanding the analysis to more cities and time periods to improve applicability.

Exploring other socioeconomic factors, such as income inequality and education levels, to gain a more complete picture of the determinants of crime.

Enhancing the model with machine learning techniques for predictive analysis.
